Wrapper for acme-tiny
=====================

Really dirty wrapper arround acme-tiny, installs the certs in a certain place and sets up the cron job.

Really, really minimum effort was put in this script, running it multiple times is **not** supported as it will install the cronjob every single time.

Also, don't move this folder without updating a lot of shit.
